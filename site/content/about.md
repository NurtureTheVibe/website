## About Nurture the Vibe

Welcome to *Nurture the Vibe*—where fast, fearless AI builders become battle-tested software engineers (without losing their spark).

I’m Matt. I’ve spent over a decade writing code that couldn’t afford to fail—financial systems, mission-critical 3D comms, healthcare infrastructure. The kind of stuff that doesn’t get to crash just because someone forgot a null check.

Now I’m bringing those lessons to a new generation of developers who started coding not in CS lectures or bootcamps, but in chat windows with ChatGPT.

These 'vibe coders' are fast. Brilliant. Creative. And they’re building at a pace most of us couldn’t imagine five years ago. But speed without structure eventually runs into a wall: production.

That’s where I come in.

### What We Do Here

**Nurture the Vibe** is about levelling up AI-accelerated developers by adding just enough of the old-school discipline to keep shipping safely. No lectures. No gatekeeping. Just practical systems thinking with a side of deadpan British humour.

You’ll get:

* **Practical content** – Weekly blog posts, YouTube deep-dives, and spicy social posts on real-world AI workflows.
* **Battle-tested techniques** – How to write maintainable AI-assisted code, test it, monitor it, and not wake up at 3am when it’s live.
* **Zero fluff** – No 30-minute videos to tell you what could’ve been a code snippet.

### The Big Why

Because the industry’s sneering at vibe coders—and they’re wrong.

With the right nudges, AI-native devs can outperform traditional teams. They just need better patterns, stronger defaults, and a little mentorship from someone who’s lived through the outages.

### Our Vibe

* **Tone**: Sardonic Obi-Wan with a mug of builder’s tea
* **Values**: Generosity. Engineering rigour. Transparency. Community over ego.
* **Goal**: Help you ship faster, break less, and get hired for more than just prototyping.

Ready to vibe harder *and* smarter?

Let’s get to work.
